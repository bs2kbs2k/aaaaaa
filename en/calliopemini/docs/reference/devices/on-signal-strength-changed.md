# On Signal Strength Changed

Register code to run when the signal strength of the paired device changes.

### ~hint

The functions in the `devices` namespace allow the @boardname@ to communicate with a separate (remote) device, such as a smartphone, over Bluetooth (Smart). The set of supported events will depend on the remote device and the @boardname@ apps available for the remote device.

### ~

```sig
devices.onSignalStrengthChanged(() => {})
```

### Parameters

* `body`: code to run when the signal strength changes.

### Examples

Display the signal strength on screen:

```blocks
devices.onSignalStrengthChanged(() => {
    basic.showNumber(devices.signalStrength(), 150)
})
```
