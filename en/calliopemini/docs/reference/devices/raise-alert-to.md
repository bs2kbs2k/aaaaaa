# raise alert to

Raise an alert on a remote device.

### ~hint

The functions in the `devices` namespace allow the @boardname@ to communicate with a separate (remote) device, such as a smartphone, over Bluetooth (Smart). The set of supported events will depend on the remote device and the @boardname@ apps available for the remote device.
