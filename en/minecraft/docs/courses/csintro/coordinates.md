# Lesson 3: Coordinates

This lesson will cover how to move around in a Minecraft world with respect to the three-coordinate grid represented by (X Y Z) coordinates and the difference between relative position and world position. Weâ€™ll also show you how to create a compass rose to help you find your way around and create a tool that allows you to copy and paste entire structures in the Minecraft world.

Search the web for quick ways to remember the X, Y, and Z axes!
