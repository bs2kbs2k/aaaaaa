# Lesson 2: Events

In this lesson, we will learn about events and event handlers, which are important concepts in computer science and can be found in all programming languages. We will start with a fun unplugged activity that demonstrates cause and effect, and how events trigger actions in the real world. Next, we’ll get hands-on with MakeCode in Minecraft, and finally, we’ll challenge you to create your own MakeCode projects that use events to activate different parts of your program.
