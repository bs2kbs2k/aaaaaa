The Code Connection app is downloaded as a Windows installation package. Find the **CodeConnection.msi** file and double-click on it to start the installation.

## Step 3: Create a Minecraft world

You'll need a fresh world with cheats enabled.

#### 1. Start

Start Minecraft

### 2. Create a world

Press the **Play** button. Push the **Create New** button in the **Worlds** dialog. The **Create...** window will have some default templates you could choose from but make your own world with the **Create New World** button.

### 3. Turn on cheats

You'll see some settings for your new world. Leave everything as you see it except for **Cheats**. You need to turn **Activate Cheats** to the **ON** position to enable all of the coding features for MakeCode.

### 4. The world begins

Press **Create** and you can start playing in your new world.

## Step 4: Start Code Connection

Start the Code Connection app (you'll find the icon on your desktop). Right away you'll see a window asking you to make a connection to Minecraft by entering a slash command on the chat line. The command tells Minecraft to connect with a certain address. You can just press the copy button and the command will copy to the clipboard.

Now, go to your Minecraft game with the world just created. **Hit the "T" key to open the chat bar.** Paste in the slash command you just copied from Code Connection by pressing Ctrl+V and press "enter" or hit the arrow button.

Code Connection will popup another window with a number of editors to choose from. Hit "esc" to leave the game momentarily. Go over to the Code Connection window and press the **MakeCode** button, of course. The MakeCode editor will load. Select "New Project" in the "My Projects" gallery to start a fresh project. If you want to try a tutorial or another example instead, pick one of those from the galleries.

## Step 5: Gameplay with your code

To run your code in Minecraft, go back to the game after working with your coding project. Press **Resume Game**. Depending on what your code is meant to do, your code might run as a chat command or maybe start when some condition in the game changes. Try one of the [tutorials](/tutorials) and follow the steps.

Minecraft has keyboard controls that help you move around and do tasks. Here's a helpful key card that shows what they are:
