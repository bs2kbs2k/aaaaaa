## Step 2: Install Minecraft: Education Edition

If you're eligible to use it, download [**Minecraft: Education Edition**](https://education.minecraft.net/get-started/download) for your computer (either Windows 10 or macOS).

[`|Download|`](https://education.minecraft.net/get-started/download)

You can download once and install on multiple computers if you want. If you have trouble or want to find out how to do multiple installations, see the `InstallationInstructions-README_ text` file in the package folder. You can also find more installation information at the Minecraft: Education Edition [knowledgebase](https://education.minecraft.net/support/knowledgebase/) in the *Installation and Getting Started* section.

## Step 3: Get Code Connection

Once you have the game installed, youâ€™ll need to download and install the **Code Connection** app. You get this from same [**download**](https://education.minecraft.net/download) location as Minecraft: Education Edition.

[`|Download|`](https://education.minecraft.net/get-started/download)

### Windows 10

The Code Connection app is downloaded as a Windows installation package. You can just choose **Run** at the time of the download. Otherwise, if you save it to a download folder, find the *CodeConnection.msi* file and double-click on it to start the installation.

### macOs

The installation is downloaded as a DMG package.

## Step 4: Setting up Minecraft for MakeCode

Here's how to get setup and connected to MakeCode for the first time...

### Setup Minecraft

#### 1. Start

Start Minecraft and sign in if you're using Minecraft: Education Edition.  


#### 2. Create a world

Press the **Play** button. Push the **Create New** button in the **Worlds** dialog. The **Create...** window will have some default templates you could choose from but make your own world with the **Create New World** button.

#### 3. Turn on cheats

You'll see some settings for your new world. Leave everything as you see it except for **Cheats**. You need to turn **Activate Cheats** to the **ON** position to enable all of the coding features for MakeCode.

#### 4. The world begins

Press **Create** and you can start playing in your new world.

#### 5. Start Code Connection

Start the Code Connection app. Right away you'll see a window asking you to make a connection to Minecraft by entering a slash command on the chat line. The command tells Minecraft to connect with a certain address. You can just press the copy button and the command will copy to the clipboard.

Now, go to your **Minecraft: Education Edition** game with the world just created. Hit the "T" key to open the chat bar. Paste in the slash command you just copied from Code Connection and press "enter" or hit the arrow button.

Code Connection will popup another window with a number of editors to choose from. Hit "esc" to leave the game momentarily. Go over to the Code Connection window and press the **MakeCode** button, of course. The MakeCode editor will load. Select "New Project" in the "My Projects" gallery to start a fresh project. If you want to try a tutorial or another example instead, pick one of those from the galleries.

## Gameplay with your code

To run your code in Minecraft: Education Edition, go back to the game after working with your coding project. Press **Resume Game**. Depending on what your code is meant to do, your code might run as a chat command or maybe start when some condition in the game changes. Try one of the [tutorials](/tutorials) and follow the steps.

Minecraft has keyboard controls that help you move around and do tasks. Here's a helpful key card that shows what they are:
