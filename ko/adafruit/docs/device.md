# 장치 구성

## Get the @boardname@

You can start out coding the @boardname@ using the [simulator](/device/simulator) or, get the real board here: [@boardname@](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

## USB 연결

When you plug in your @boardname@ with a [USB](/device/usb) cable, it will appear as new storage device called `@drivename@`.

## Powering your @boardname@

When your @boardname@ is connected to your computer with the micro USB, it doesn’t need another power source. If it's not connected to your computer, tablet or mobile, you will need 3 x AAA 1.5 V batteries to power it.

The pins labeled **3.3V** and **GND** are the power supply pins. You can attach an external device such as a motor to these and power it using the battery or USB.

If you want, you can also buy the [base kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3517) which includes a battery pack and batteries.

## Drivers and bootloader

윈도우 운영체제에서 USB 의 모든 기능을 사용하기 위해서는, 별도의 추가적인 드라이버를 설치해야 할 수 있습니다. See the [Windows driver installation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/adafruit2-windows-driver-installation) page at https://www.adafruit.com.

Updates for the bootloader are found here: [Updating the bootloader](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/adafruit2-uf2-bootloader-details#updating-the-bootloader)

**Advanced users**

The bootloader is the "system software" for your @boardname@.
