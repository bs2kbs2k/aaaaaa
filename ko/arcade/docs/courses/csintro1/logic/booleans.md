# Activity: Boolean Statements and Expressions

In the previous lessons, we saw how `||logic:if||` and `||logic:else||` statements allow us to write code that can handle different situations by making comparisons between different numbers.

Comparison statements are centered around **Boolean logic**, with the conditions evaluating to either `||logic:true||` or `||logic:false||`.

These expressions values, and can be stored and used as `Boolean` variables. Whenever we see the term Boolean - it means we have something that can evaluate to `||logic:true||` or `||logic:false||`.

In these activities students will work with:

* Boolean flags and values (`||logic:true||` and `||logic:false||`)
* `||logic:and||` 
* `||logic:or||`
* `||logic:not||`

## Concept: Boolean Flags

Boolean values are regularly used to help maintain the **state** of a given piece of code. It is common to describe variables as "Boolean flags" - these often are used to turn on and off different behaviors that might be useful.

For example, `||sprites:stay in screen||` is a flag that we have set that forces the sprite to stay within the bounds of the screen when set to `||logic:true||`.

## Example #1: Are you hungry?

1. Review the code below
2. Create the sample code and run the code
3. Identify what needs to be done in game to `||game:splash||` "You're hungry!", and what needs to be done to `||game:splash||` "You're not hungry!"

```blocks
let isHungry = false
controller.B.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    if (isHungry) {
        game.splash("You're hungry!")
    } else {
        game.splash("You're not hungry!")
    }
})
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    isHungry = true
})
game.splash("Press A if you are hungry!")
isHungry = false
```

In this example, `||variables:isHungry||` is a flag that will change the behavior of the `||controller:on B button pressed||` event. When it is off (set to false), the game assumes that you are not hungry; when you turn it on (set to true), though, it tells the game that you **are** hungry, and it reacts to this information.

## Student Task #1: Off and On

1. Start with the code from example #1
2. Modify the `||controller:on A button pressed||` event so that it **switches** the value of `||variables:isHungry||` from `||logic:true||` to `||logic:false||` or from `||logic:false||` to `||logic:true||`, by using an `||logic:if else||` block

## Concept: `||logic:and||` & `||logic:or||`

Beyond just using a single Boolean value, there are several ways in which we can combine these values. The most commonly used are `||logic:and||` and `||logic:or||`. These are very similar to the definition in plain english; for example, the statement

> If I have food and I am hungry, I will make lunch

means that if **both** conditions (there being food, and being hungry) are true, then lunch will be made. If either is false, though, no lunch will be made.

Similarly, the statement

> If I need to buy milk or I need to buy eggs, I will go to the store

means that if **either** condition is true, I will go to the store. If I don't need to buy milk and I also don't need to buy eggs, then I will not end up going to the store.

## Example #2a: `||logic:and||`

1. Review the code below
2. Create the sample code and run the code
3. Identify which combinations of true and false evaluate to true, and which evaluate to false

```blocks
if (true && true)   game.splash("true and true is true")
else                game.splash("true and true is false")

if (true && false)  game.splash("true and false is true")
else                game.splash("true and false is false")

if (false && false) game.splash("false and false is true")
else                game.splash("false and false is false")
```

## Example #2b: `||logic:or||`

1. Review the code below
2. Create the sample code and run the code
3. Identify which combinations of true or false evaluate to true, and which evaluate to false

https://makecode.com/_3PWUwFdxC97c

```blocks
if (true || true)   game.splash("true or true is true")
else                game.splash("true or true is false")

if (true || false)  game.splash("true or false is true")
else                game.splash("true or false is false")

if (false || false) game.splash("false or false is true")
else                game.splash("false or false is false")
```

## Student Task #2: Using `||logic:and||` and `||logic:or||`

1. Create a new project
2. Create a sprite, and use `||controller:control sprite with||` to make it move when the directional keys are pressed
3. In the `||game:on game update||` block, add an `||logic:if||` statement that makes the sprite `||sprites:say||` "hello" for 200 ms. Use `||logic:and||` to make this happen when the `||sprites:sprite x||` **and** `||sprites:sprite y||` values are both less than 30
4. In the `||game:on game update||` block, add another `||logic:if||` statement that makes the sprite `|sprites:say||` "bye" for 200 ms when the `||sprites:sprite x||` **or** the `||sprites:sprite y||` is greater than 80
5. **Challenge**: Create the same behavior while using one or more `||logic:not||` blocks

## What did we learn?

1. What is a boolean flag? Describe a case in which you might you want to use one?
2. What is the difference between an `||logic:and||` block and an `||logic:or||` block? 
    * In what cases will they both evaluate to true?
    * In what cases will they both evaluate to false?
    * In what cases will they evaluate differently?
