# Unplugged: Using a Controller

In this activity, you will learn about events and how they drive actions.

1. Look at the Events Controller as a class.

2. Decide as a class what each button does (for example, red square - clap, purple star - stomp, blue triangle - Say "YEAH", etc)

3. As your teacher taps the buttons on the overhead, react based on the actions associated with each button

4. When your teacher presses a button, that is an "event". An event lets you know what you are expected to do next

5. As a class, come up with some task to do (for example, counting or singing a song)

6. As a class, begin executing the task while paying attention to the actions your teacher and responding to button presses
