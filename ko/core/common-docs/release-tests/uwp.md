The following project is useful to test serial: https://makecode.com/_Tj9eTqLk2Xza

Open it to test the sim serial, and flash it on a device to test device serial

* [ ] Simulator serial 
    * [ ] Pres A to toggle X Acceleration data logging on / off, and make sure it's logged in the graph view
    * [ ] Press B to send a console message and make sure it is logged in the console view
* [ ] Device serial 
    * [ ] Pres A to toggle X Acceleration data logging on / off, and make sure it's logged in the graph view
    * [ ] Press B to send a console message and make sure it is logged in the console view
    * [ ] Disconnect & reconnect the device while Acceleration is being logged, and make sure serial still works
    * [ ] Disconnect & reconnect the device while Acceleration is not being logged, toggle logging on using A, and make sure serial still works
