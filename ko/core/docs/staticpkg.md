# Deploying PXT with static files

There are multiple ways to deploy your PXT target. * hosted by Microsoft \--- this is currently only supported for internal Microsoft targets * publish your target to NPM and then require users to do `pxt target yourtarget` and `pxt serve` * generate static HTML/JS/CSS files and host them on HTTP server of your choosing (free GitHub Pages will do nicely)

This documentation page deals with the last option.

## Manual file generation

Running `pxt staticpkg` will create a number of files under `built/packaged`. These can be served as is using any web server. You can use `pxt serve -pkg`.

You can also run `pxt staticpkg foo`, which will create files under `built/packaged/foo` that assume they sit under `/foo/` on the web server. If you do not specify anything, the files assume they sit right under `/`. To test it, run `pxt server -pkg` and head to `http://localhost:3232/foo/index.html`.

## [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) support

GitHub provides you with free hosting for your project files.

If you have not yet setup `gh-pages` branch, run `pxt ghpinit` from your target repository root. This will create a fresh checkout `built/gh-pages` and create `gh-pages` branch.

When you already have the `gh-pages` branch, you can just run `pxt ghppush`. This will: * create a fresh checkout in `built/gh-pages` if needed * implicityly run `pxt staticpkg repo-name` * copy files from `built/packaged/repo-name` to `built/gh-pages` * add files to git, commit, and push

You can then head to `https://your-username.github.io/repo-name/`.

## Multiple targets

It is possible to host multiple editors under the same pages domains.
