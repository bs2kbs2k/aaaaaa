# Lesson 9: Artificial Intelligence

In this chapter, weâ€™ll dive into the popular field of Artificial Intelligence, or "AI". The art and science of crafting programs that mimic, and even surpass human intelligence, AI is tremendously important to the future of computer science.

## CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards

Targeted standards for this lesson:

* Identify factors that distinguish humans from machines. 
* Recognize that computers model intelligent behavior. >**Examples:** computer opponents in gaming, speech and language recognition, robotics, computer animation of real world systems.  
    >**Resource:** The CS Standards Crosswalk with CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards for State/District/Course Standards - http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/K12Standards.html

### Additional CSTA Standards

* **CL.L2-03** - Collaborate with peers, experts, and others using collaborative practices such as pair programming, working in project teams, and participating in group active learning activities. 
* **CL.L2-04** - Exhibit dispositions necessary for collaboration: providing useful feedback, integrating feedback, understanding and accepting multiple perspectives, socialization. 
* **CL.L3A-01** - Work in a team to design and develop a software artifact.
* K-12 Computer Science Framework Core concept: Control Structures 
* **CT.L2-12** - Use abstraction to decompose a problem into sub problems
* **CPP.L1:6-05** - Construct a program as a set of step-by-step instructions to be acted out
* **CPP.L1:6-06** - Implement problem solutions using a block-based visual programming language
* **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-2** - Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem
