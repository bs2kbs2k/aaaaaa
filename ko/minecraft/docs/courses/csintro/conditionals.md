# Lesson 6: Conditionals

Computer programs are made up of instructions that tell the computer how to process input and deliver output. In Minecraft, the instructions you write are triggered by events or by commands, and they control what actions take place in the Minecraft world. An important part of programming is telling the computer WHEN to perform a certain task. For this, we use something called 'conditionals', because a certain Condition or Rule has to be met before an action is performed.
