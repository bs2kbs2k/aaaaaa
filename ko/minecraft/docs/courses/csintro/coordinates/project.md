# Independent Project

For your independent project, create one or more commands that alter the landscape in some way. Here are some ideas:

* In a set area, replace all blocks of a certain type with something new (for example, replace all grass with lava).
* Create an "instant swimming pool" filled with water or... lava!
* Create a way to instantly tunnel through a mountain or portions of the nether.
* Create a way to literally "move mountains."
* Make a rainbow.
* Improve the Minecraft Moving Company activity so that you can enter a height for the upper coordinate rather than having to actually stand there yourself.
* Experiment with the **Mask** and **Mode** menus on the `||blocks:clone||` block.

Your project should do the following:

* Use coordinates in some way
* Alter the landscape by using code
* Be creative and original

**예시:**

This project allows you to create a section of paved road with streetlights.

Duplicate this section numerous times to create a new street of any length.

* How did you come up with this idea? What problem are you trying to solve and why?
* What did you decide to alter in the landscape? 
* What does your program do?
* Describe how your program alters the landscape.
* Include at least one screenshot of the result of your program.
