# Unplugged Activity: Events and Handlers

## ~hint

**Teacher Note**

An unplugged activity is an activity that takes place away from the computer, i.e., “unplugged” from a device. We usually try to introduce new concepts in a fun way that gets kids up and moving, often reacting and interacting with other students face-to-face while playing a game or completing a challenge. Unplugged activities allow kids to practice concepts away from the computer so that when they move to activities on the computer, they have already walked through and thought about the concept on their own.

## Objective

To reinforce the event-driven programming model by acting out events and the resulting actions encapsulated by an event handler.

## Overview

Identify one-third of the class to be the “Events”, and the rest of the class will be the “Event Handlers”.

For the “Event” students, have them come up with an event to model. Students should invent their own events, but some examples could be:

* Door opens
* Lights turn off
* Clap hands twice
* Both hands raised

Once they’ve decided on their event, students should write down their event twice, on 2 different index cards. These cards should be shuffled and passed out to the “Event Handler” students.

Once the “Event Handler” students have received their assigned events, they should come up with some sort of action to take based on this event. Students should invent their own actions, but some examples could be:

* Door opens --> Walk outside
* Lights turn off --> Go to sleep
* Clap hands twice --> Stomp feet 3 times
* Both hands raised --> Say “Touchdown!”

Line up the “Event” students at the front of the classroom, and have each one perform their event. When the event is performed, the associated “Event Handler” students for that given event should also perform the subsequent action.

Once all the event and event handlers have been called, you can randomly call on different “Event” students to perform, and trigger different event handlers – you can speed this up and see if the students react quickly to their assigned event.

## 준비물

* Index cards
* Pens or pencils 

## Rules

* Unless instructed otherwise, students do not speak or make noise during this activity unless it is part of their event or action. 
* Students should be aware of the activities of the other people in the classroom, but cannot tell other students what to do. 

## Reflections

Have a discussion about how that felt/worked:

* Were there any programming errors or bugs in the system? Did a student miss handling an event?
* What was it like to keep track of the different events going on?
* Sometimes there was more than 1 event handler for a given event… how does that work?
* Could there be 1 event handler for multiple events? (yes)
* Could an event handler also trigger an event? (yes) If so, how would that work? (Lights turn off --> Go to sleep --> Teacher says “Wake up!”)

## Tips

* SAFETY FIRST! Students, especially younger ones, can get quite silly with this and while it is meant to be fun and even funny, safety first!

**Computer programming connection**

Computer programs are a set of instructions telling the computer how to process input and deliver output. An important part of programming is telling the computer WHEN to perform a certain task. Events are a way to trigger certain instructions.
