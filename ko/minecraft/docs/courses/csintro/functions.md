# Lesson 7: Functions

Often in programming, there are tasks or procedures that are used frequently within the same program. Rather than rewrite the lines of code that perform a particular task each time you need it, you can group that set of instructions together as a function. Grouping frequently used instructions as a function makes your code more efficient. You can write the set of instructions once as a function and from then on simply ‘call’ the function from inside your program whenever you need that task done. A function is usually given a name that describes the task it will perform when called, making your code easier to read, too!

## CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards

Targeted standards for this lesson:

* **2-AP-13** - Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.
* **2-AP-14** - Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.
* **3A-CS-01** - Explain how abstractions hide the underlying implementation details of computing systems embedded in everyday objects.
* **3A-AP-13** - Create prototypes that use algorithms to solve computational problems by leveraging prior student knowledge and personal interests.
