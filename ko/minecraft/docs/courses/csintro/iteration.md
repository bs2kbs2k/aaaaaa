# Lesson 5: Iteration

In this lesson, we’ll explore ways to make things repeat. You might repeat actions in a program to have a certain effect, or you might use repetition to accomplish the same task in a smaller number of steps. We’ll introduce you to the Agent, your own personal robot who can accomplish tasks for you like building a farm, and we’ll create some original dance moves so your Agent can get down and dance on the floor. Finally, we’ll challenge you to write your own program to direct your Agent to do something cool.
