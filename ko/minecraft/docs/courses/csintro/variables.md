# Lesson 4: Variables

In this lesson, we’ll explore the concept of a variable, an important way to store information and make your programs more flexible and adaptable. We’ll build on what we have learned about Events by using a variable to pass additional information in when an event occurs. Finally, we’ll challenge you to write your own program using variables to customize how it runs.
