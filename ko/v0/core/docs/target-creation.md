# Target Creation

PXT is built to allow targeting different coding environment, called **targets**. In this page, we'll go through the steps necessary to get your target with your own blocks and runtime.

Examples of targets are: * https://makecode.microbit.org (sources at https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-microbit) * http://microsoft.github.io/pxt-sample/ (sources at https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-sample)

* https://pxt.microbit.org
* https://pxt.adafruit.com
* http://microsoft.github.io/pxt-sample/

Since this is a rather technical topic, we assume that the reader is familiar with Node.JS, NPM and JavaScript and/or C++.

* [시뮬레이터](/targets/simulator)

A target contains the following folders:

* `/libs`, packages (sometimes referred to as libraries) that define the JavaScript and APIs and how they should be exposed in blocks.
* `/sim`, TypeScript source for the in-browser simulator (if any).
* `/docs`, markdown documentation pages

* If you haven't do so yet, install Node.JS and the **PXT** command line

    npm install -g pxt
    

* Get a copy of the [sample target sources](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-sample) and open it in your favorite editor.
* Open a command prompt in the target folder and run these commands to setup the tools.

    npm install
    

At this point, pick an identifier for your target. Use only alphanumeric characters as it will be used in various routing operations.

### Updating `package.json`

Your target will eventually have to be published to NPM so go ahead and update the `package.json` file with your target id, repositories locations, etc... * it might be a good time to check that your target id is available in NPM as well.

### Updating `pxtarget.json`

The `pxtarget.json` file contains the configuration options of your target. We'll talk about it deeply later. For now, update the `id`, `corpkg`, `name` and `title` fields to reflect your target information.

* Tip: keep searching and replacing all instances of `sample` in `pxtarget.json`.

### Updating assets

Graphical assets are located under `/docs/static`.

### Updating the `sample` package

The `libs/core` package of *pxt-sample* defines a *minimal* package structure.

In fact, the APIs of *pxt-sample* live in the `sim/api.ts` (annotated to expose [TypeScript functions as blocks](/defining-blocks)), as this target is only for the web. The PXT compiler generates the file `libs/core/sim.d.ts` from the simulator code.

See [creating a PXT package](/packages) for more information on authoring packages, which includes code in the package itself. For now, you can try adding a new API to one of the existing namespaces in`sim/api.ts` with annotations to make a new block.

Templates are the default projects for your target. There is one default blocks project, and one default JavaScript project. The initial templates are empty projects.

* To change the default blocks project, modify the package under `libs/blocksprj`
* To change the default JavaScript project, modify the package under `libs/tsprj`

### Testing the target locally

Now that you've updated your target, it is ready to be run locally. Run the following command:

    pxt serve
    

The editor will automatically open the target API project which you can edit directly in PXT. At this point, we recommend to create a new project using blocks that will serve as a sandbox. New projects are created under the `/projects` folder when testing a target locally (and are automatically "git-ignored"). You can use these projects to change your templates. Simply copy the contents of your project under `/projects` to one of the templates under `/libs/templates/`.

Whenever you make a change, the local web server will trigger a build. Simply reload the page once the build is done.

## Defining APIs and Blocks

The APIs available in the PXT environment are loaded from TypeScript package (library) files (the ones under `/libs`). They can optionally be [auto-generated](/simshim) from C++ library files or from TypeScript simulator files.

Read more about [how to annotate your APIS](/defining-blocks) to expose them as blocks in PXT.

## Path rewriting

When uploading to PXT cloud URLs of various files are rewritten to ones pointing to the CDN. There are three kinds of URLs on the CDN:

* `/blob/<blob_hash>/some/path/filename.ext` - where the path and file name can be arbitrary
* `/commit/<commit_hash>/path/in/that/commit/filename.ext` - where the path actually comes from the commit
* `/tree/<tree_hash>/path/in/that/tree/filename.ext` - where the path actually comes from the tree

Whenever possible, `/blob/` URLs should be used, since they only change when the file changes. This allows for faster app updates.

For an example, compare https://pxt.microbit.org/\---manifest and https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt/blob/master/webapp/public/release.manifest

Generally, PXT will rewrite URLs starting with `/cdn/` to `/commit/...` and ones starting with `/blb/` to `/blob/...`. This happens in manifest and HTML files, as well as some JavaScript files (web worker sources and `embed.js`). Part of that rewriting happens client-side when uploading (strings like `@commitCdnUrl@` and `@blobCdnUrl@` are introduced), and part happens in the cloud.

Currently, in simulator files only, all of `/cdn/`, `/sim/` and `/blb/` are rewritten to `/blob/...`. Going forward however, simulator files should use `/blb/` explicitly to make the intent clear.

The main reason to use `/cdn/` instead of `/blb/` is when resources require relative paths. This is for example the case for Blockly media files.

The `/tree/...` URLs are not yet supported in rewriting.
