## Step 1: Design the guitar body

* Search for [Guitar Silhouette](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=Guitar+Silhouettes) design ideas and customize the shape of your guitar.
* Trace the design on a flat piece of cardboard (40-80 cm is best).

* Use a straight-edge or ruler for lines
* 판지를 자르기 어려운, 작고 복잡한 모양은 피하세요.

## 단계 2: 기타 몸체 모양 잘라내기

* Use box cutters to cut away big areas of cardboard, and use scissors to cut out the detailed parts

You can use another piece of cardboard on the back to reinforce the creases in the cardboard and other thin parts like the neck.
